# Todo List Application

This project is built using React and Firebase. The goal of this project is to deliver a fullstack, serviceable application.

By building this project, I've:
- Learned intermediate React (context, hooks, components, ...)
- Learned and implemented Firebase (authentication, firestore)
- Honed and further my skills in programming web applications

At the end of the project, I've successfully created my first fullstack web application.
